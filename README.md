Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.


SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used by software development teams to design, develop, test, deploy, and maintain software systems. It provides a framework for managing the entire software development process from conception to retirement. 

Here’s an overview of the typical phase/stages in the SDLC:

Requirements Analysis:

In this stage, developers gather and analyze user requirements through Interviews, surveys, meetings with stakeholders to gather requirements. This is achieved by utilizing SRS (Software requirements specification). This is a document specifying the functional and non-functional requirements of the software.

Planning

Here the team develops a plan for the project, including outlining the schedule, budget, resource allocation, and risk management strategies. In this stage, the basic project is designed with all the available information obtained from customers inputs, and sales/market surve

Design

With the Software requirements specification(SRS) as a reference, software developers are able to create a blueprint or architectural design for the software and develop design document specifications(DDS) that is assessed by the market analysts and stakeholders. The most logical and practical design is chosen for development. 


Implementation(Coding) 

This is the stage where the team of developers start implementing the project plan on developing the software. Here they use a specific code based on the design specifications. Some of the programming tools being put in use at this stage includes; Writing codes, debugging, interpreters etc. Some languages that are also put in use are Java, python etc.

Testing

In other to verify that the software meets the specified requirements and works correctly, the testing of the software is necessary. Here, all the possible errors are being identified, fixed and retested 

Deployment

This is where the software is released to users after a well detailed testing. If software performs well the company sends out the software with improvements such as user training documents as a support that provide information on how to use the software. 

Maintenance

Ensure that the software remains operational and meets changing user needs over time. Here the monitor the system and make assessments on how fit this product is. If necessary they also make some adjustments and repairs in order to maintain the quality of the system.


Overall, the SDLC is essential for ensuring the successful and efficient development of software systems, from initial concept to final deployment and beyond.
